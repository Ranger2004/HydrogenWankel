Homogeneous Two-Zone Finite Release Cycle to predict NO emissions for hydrogen rotary engines
This project is the result of my thesis work in mechanical engineering at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.
This work has been done to predict NO emissions for a hydrogen rotary engine.

To run the program :
  1. Select the python program "main.py"
  2. Set the parameters of the engine (equivalence ratio, initial pressure, initial temperature, ...)
  3. Run the program

The results obtain are :
  1. The IMEP
  2. The NO emit
  3. Plots about volume, pressure, temperature of burned and unburned gas and the burned fraction rate according to the crank angle

Corrections or improvements are Welcome :)
